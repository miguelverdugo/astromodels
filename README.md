# AstroModels

A library with models not present in the astropy.modelling but using its API

## 1D models

  - Rotation Curves
  - Velocity Dispersion distributions (e.g. SIS)
  - Luminosity/Density profiles
  - Luminosity functions

## 2D models

  - Velocity Fields
  - Velocity dispersion distributions
  - Luminosity/Density distributions



## Spatial distributions  (2D on the plane)

  - NFW Profiles
  - King Profile
  - Gaussian
  - Sersic
  - Power Law

## Luminosity distributions

  - Schechter
  - Power Law
  - Two component power law for AGNs, (is necessary?)
  - IMFs?
  - Uniform

## Considerations

  - Use the astropy.modelling framework
  - Luminosity distributions can be redistributed into spatial ones, and viceversa
  - Spatial distributions should also accept ellipticity
